# RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology

This repository will house important information for collecting, storing, and analysing environmental data (via HOBO loggers) and thermal images for sites collected as part of RIBBiTR. 

## HOBO DATA

HOBO data loggers will be deployed within all study systems to collect detailed measurements of amphibian-relevant microclimates, and to verify
temperatures downscaled from global temperature databases. HOBO data loggers will record microclimate at 3-5 key sites within each study system,
focusing on primary survey sites. 

**Please refer to the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document for setting up and deploying HOBO loggers.**

## THERMAL IMAGES

This [sign-out sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hg0DTGzJy9akMPVVxuNyOvGWWmSTO8_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) has information on where thermal camera's associated with
RIBBiTR are housed or which teams are using them. You can refer to it to organize obtaining a thermal camera for 
field sites and seasons.

### Setting up thermal cameras

More information on setting up thermal cameras can be found in the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document.
