# RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology :frog:

This repository contains important information for collecting, storing, and analyzing environmental data (via HOBO loggers) and thermal images for sites collected as part of RIBBiTR.

## HOBO DATA

HOBO data loggers will be deployed within all study systems to collect detailed measurements of amphibian-relevant microclimates, and to verify
temperatures downscaled from global temperature databases. HOBO data loggers will record microclimate at 3-5 key sites within each study system,
focusing on primary survey sites. 

Please refer to the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document for setting up and deploying HOBO loggers. ***All HOBO logger metadata should be recorded in the ['HOBO logger deployment data'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfQ0dcc5GuQWfGMUiJk_oN1VKh7THmMT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) spreadsheet
found within the Ecophysiology team's google drive folder.***

### Setting up HOBO loggers and downloading HOBO data

Hobo loggers can be set-up using HOBOware or using the waterproof data shuttle (U-DTW-1 shuttle â€“ NOTE: requires HOBOware Pro software). 
:bangbang:***IMPORTANT:*** Please ensure that when setting up the loggers that your computer's clock and timezone are accurate - HoboWare uses this to
set the clock on the loggers *AND* that all loggers are setup using the same timezone *AND* the timezone matches the timezone where you are deploying the loffers.

Data can be downloaded using the waterproof data shuttle which can store data until you reach a computer, or the USB shuttle (BASE-U-4) directly 
connected to a computer. Bluetooth data loggers are launched and data can be downloaded via the HOBOconnect App.

:bangbang:***IMPORTANT***: Date and time of deployment and date and time the logger was removed from the field should be recorded in the ['HOBO logger deployment data'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfQ0dcc5GuQWfGMUiJk_oN1VKh7THmMT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) spreadsheet
found within the Ecophysiology team's google drive folder.

### Storing HOBO data :file_folder:

:file_folder: **Storage**: Please store all HOBO data as .hobo files. All HOBO data will be stored in the ['HOBO Logger Data'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oFI-eyaX6w-DHK5Gl44ThiE0Vf8JFNVv?usp=share_link) google drive folder. To standardize storage, please create a new folder within the directory for your study system (i.e., Brazil, Panama, etc.) with the following naming convention... ```HOBOS_MonthYrDeployed_MonthYrStopped```. The date should be in the 'Month,Year' format (for example, Nov22), and all files for that sampling time-period/season can be housed within this newly-created directory.

:label: **File naming system**: Individal .hobo files should be named with the region, site number, deployment location, and deployement depth or height as follows: 
```SiteID_DeployementLocation_depthORheight``` for example, *'Rio.Blanco_shade_25cm.hobo'*. :bangbang:***IMPORTANT:*** **This name should also match the 
'*hobo_name*' colomn in the ['HOBO logger deployment data'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfQ0dcc5GuQWfGMUiJk_oN1VKh7THmMT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) spreadsheet.** 

Deployment location and height/depth categories are: 
  ```
     sun_0cm        shade_0cm         soil_-5cm       water_5cm
     sun_25cm       shade_25cm        soil_-10cm      water_20cm
     sun_50cm       shade_50cm                        water_35cm                 
  ```  

### Exporting HOBO files :inbox_tray:

The Ecophysiology team will export, trim, and combine the microclimate data collected by field teams for entry into the RIBBiTR Database. 

Use HOBOware Pro to 'bulk export' files from the ['HOBO Logger Data'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oFI-eyaX6w-DHK5Gl44ThiE0Vf8JFNVv?usp=share_link) google 
drive folder to a local directory. 
Settings for export in HOBOware should be as follows: Export file type = .csv; Date format = YMD; Date seperator = Slash(/); Time format = 24-Hour. All
other default settings can be used.

### Trimming HOBO data :scissors:

Before trimming data, ensure that all files are logged in the same timezone. The format of data within the date-time column should also be standardized. To check the
timezone of files, standardize column names and formats, and to trim data, use the ['*TrimHOBOFiles.R*'](https://github.com/Jennycocciardi/RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology/blob/main/TrimHOBOFiles.R) script. This script will create an output folder within the local directory, where it
will create a new *'.csv'* for each file with the naming convention: *'SiteID_DeployementLocation_depthORheight_trimmed.csv'* (for example, *'Admin_sun_50cm_trimmed.csv'*).

The ['*TrimHOBOFiles.R*'](https://github.com/Jennycocciardi/RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology/blob/main/TrimHOBOFiles.R) script requires an additional metadata file
that contains logger start and stop times to automate trimming. This file should be named '*trimming_info.csv*' and should be placed within the same
directory as the data files (there should be one for each study system per sampling period). It should be in the format:
```
hobo_name, start_date.time, stop_date.time
```
The ```hobo_name``` column will be the reference ID, so make sure this column matches the file names precisely. 
The ```start_date.time``` and ```stop_date.time``` information should be obtained from the ['HOBO logger deployment data'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfQ0dcc5GuQWfGMUiJk_oN1VKh7THmMT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) spreadsheet.
I've found that the time recorded may not be exactly when the loggers were deployed/removed from the field, and so it's best to trim the data by an extra ~5 hrs 
to remove inaccuracies. Please see the ['*trimming_info.csv*'](https://github.com/Jennycocciardi/RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology/blob/main/trimming_info.csv) file in this repository 
for an example of how to format.

### Concatenating HOBO data

After trimming the data, the Ecophysiology team will combine data across sites for input into the RIBBiTR Database. 
The ['*CombineHOBOfiles.R*'](https://github.com/Jennycocciardi/RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology/blob/main/CombineHOBOFiles.R) script can be used to create an overall, 
*'combined.csv'*, in addition to one .csv file per deployement location for each study system (e.g., *'sun.csv'*, *'shade.csv'*). This script will use the
the *'_trimmed.csv'* files in the 'output' directory and create columns based on the name of each file to add a ```Site```, ```Location```, and ```Height``` column, before 
combining files.

### Long-term storage

The *'combined.csv'* file will be sent to the RIBBiTR Database Manager for input into the database (rename the file to include study area and time period, for example,
*'PA_combined_Jul-Dec22.csv'*.
In addition, place the combined and the seperate .csv files for each deployement location for each study system and time period within the 
'RIBBiTR Study Sites_HOBO Logger Data' directory found in the 'Data' folder in the 'Ohmer Lab' google drive. Create a new folder for each time 
period within the relevant study area's directory. 
Raw data files will also be stored on the Ohmer Lab's harddrive, as well as within the ['HOBO Logger Data'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oFI-eyaX6w-DHK5Gl44ThiE0Vf8JFNVv?usp=share_link) google drive folder in the 'Ecophyisology' team's google drive.
