# RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology :frog:

This repository contains important information for collecting, storing, and analyzing environmental data (via HOBO loggers) and thermal images for sites collected as part of RIBBiTR. 

___
## HOBO DATA

HOBO data loggers will be deployed within all study systems to collect detailed measurements of amphibian-relevant microclimates, and to verify
temperatures downscaled from global temperature databases. HOBO data loggers will record microclimate at 3-5 key sites within each study system,
focusing on primary survey sites. 

**Please refer to the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document for setting up and deploying HOBO loggers.**

## THERMAL IMAGES

This [sign-out sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hg0DTGzJy9akMPVVxuNyOvGWWmSTO8_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) has information on where thermal camera's associated with
RIBBiTR are housed or which teams are using them. You can refer to it to organize obtaining a thermal camera for 
field sites and seasons.

### Setting up thermal cameras :camera:

More information on setting up thermal cameras can be found in the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document.


### Metadata to collect in the field



### Downloading and Storing thermal images 	:file_folder:

:file_folder: **Storage**: All thermal images/FLIR photos will be stored in the ['Thermal Images_FLIr photos'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_8dMZ86P7BmLn0GG9zTTS8RomSaohe_2?usp=sharing) google drive folder. To standardize
storage, please create a new folder within your study system (i.e., Brazil, Panama, etc.) directory with the following
naming convention... *'DATE_Site'*. The date should be the date the photos were taken in 'YR,MO,DAY' format (for example, 220725),
and the site should be the site name. 

:label: **File naming system**: Individal thermal images should be named with the Transect # or Site Name, the transect meter the photo
was taken at, the cardinal direction in which the photo was taken, and the photo ID. For example, a thermal image taken at Sante Fe at
meter 60 along the transect and facing E should be *'SanteFe_60m_E_4790'*.
