# RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology :frog:

This repository contains important information for collecting, storing, and analyzing environmental data (via HOBO loggers) and thermal images for sites collected as part of RIBBiTR.

## HOBO DATA

HOBO data loggers will be deployed within all study systems to collect detailed measurements of amphibian-relevant microclimates, and to verify
temperatures downscaled from global temperature databases. HOBO data loggers will record microclimate at 3-5 key sites within each study system,
focusing on primary survey sites. 

Please refer to the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document for setting up and deploying HOBO loggers. ***All HOBO logger metadata should be recorded in the ['HOBO logger deployment data'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfQ0dcc5GuQWfGMUiJk_oN1VKh7THmMT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) spreadsheet
found within the Ecophysiology team's google drive folder.***

### Setting up HOBO loggers and downloading HOBO data

Hobo loggers can be set-up using HOBOware or using the waterproof data shuttle (U-DTW-1 shuttle â€“ NOTE: requires HOBOware Pro software). 
:bangbang:***IMPORTANT:*** Please ensure that when setting up the loggers that your computer's clock and timezone are accurate - HoboWare uses this to
set the clock on the loggers *AND* that all loggers are setup using the same timezone *AND* the timezone matches the timezone where you are deploying the loffers.

Data can be downloaded using the waterproof data shuttle which can store data until you reach a computer, or the USB shuttle (BASE-U-4) directly 
connected to a computer. Bluetooth data loggers are launched and data can be downloaded via the HOBOconnect App.

:bangbang:***IMPORTANT***: Date and time of deployment and date and time the logger was removed from the field should be recorded in the ['HOBO logger deployment data'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfQ0dcc5GuQWfGMUiJk_oN1VKh7THmMT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) spreadsheet
found within the Ecophysiology team's google drive folder.

### Storing HOBO data :file_folder:

:file_folder: **Storage**: Please store all HOBO data as .hobo files. All HOBO data will be stored in the ['HOBO Logger Data'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oFI-eyaX6w-DHK5Gl44ThiE0Vf8JFNVv?usp=share_link) google drive folder. To standardize storage, please create a new folder within the directory for your study system (i.e., Brazil, Panama, etc.) with the following naming convention... ```'HOBOS_MonthYrDeployed_MonthYrStopped'```. The date should be in the 'Month,Year' format (for example, Nov22), and all files for that sampling time-period/season can be housed within this newly-created directory.

:label: **File naming system**: Individal .hobo files should be named with the region, site number, deployment location, and deployement depth or height as follows: 
```SiteID_DeployementLocation_depthORheight``` for example, *'Rio.Blanco_shade_25cm.hobo'*. :bangbang:***IMPORTANT:*** **This name should also match the 
'*hobo_name*' colomn in the ['HOBO logger deployment data'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gfQ0dcc5GuQWfGMUiJk_oN1VKh7THmMT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) spreadsheet.** 

Deployment location and height/depth categories are: 
  ```
     sun_0cm        shade_0cm         soil_-5cm       water_5cm
     sun_25cm       shade_25cm        soil_-10cm      water_20cm
     sun_50cm       shade_50cm                        water_35cm                 
  ```  

### Trimming HOBO data :scissors:

Before trimming data, ensure that all files are using the same timezone. Also prior to trimming files, the date-time column in files should be standardized. This can be easily done using the ['*TrimHOBOFiles.R*'](https://github.com/Jennycocciardi/RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology/blob/main/TrimHOBOFiles.R) script, which includes code for standardizing colomn names, as well as the code for trimming data.

The ['*TrimHOBOFiles.R*'](https://github.com/Jennycocciardi/RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology/blob/main/TrimHOBOFiles.R) script requires an additional metadata file
that contains logger start and stop times to automate trimming. This file should be named '*trimming_info.csv*' and should be placed within the same
directory as the data files (there should be one for each study system per sampling period). It should be in the format:
```
hobo_name, start_date.time, stop_date.time
```
The hobo_name column will be the reference ID, so make sure this column matches the file names precisely.

### Concatenating HOBO data

We will combine data across sites from the same deployement locations (e.g., sun, shade) for analysis purposes. Before starting, make sure that 
individual .hobo files are named *'SiteID_DeployementLocation_depthORheight'*. The ['*CombineHOBOfiles.R*'](https://github.com/Jennycocciardi/RIBBiTR_Ecophysiology/blob/main/CombineHOBOFiles.R) script can then be used to create one .csv file per deployemnet location for each study system.

## THERMAL IMAGES

This [sign-out sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hg0DTGzJy9akMPVVxuNyOvGWWmSTO8_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106517242061380573521&rtpof=true&sd=true) has information on where thermal camera's associated with
RIBBiTR are housed or which teams are using them. You can refer to it to organize obtaining a thermal camera for 
field sites and seasons.

### Setting up thermal cameras :camera:

More information on setting up thermal cameras can be found in the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document.

### Metadata to collect in the field

More information on setting up thermal cameras can be found in the 'RIBBiTR: Core Protocols' document.

### Downloading thermal images


### Storing thermal images 	:file_folder:

:file_folder: **Storage**: All thermal images/FLIR photos will be stored in the ['Thermal Images_FLIR photos'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_8dMZ86P7BmLn0GG9zTTS8RomSaohe_2?usp=sharing) google drive folder. To standardize
storage, please create a new folder within your study system (i.e., Brazil, Panama, etc.) directory with the fieldwork season/period as the
naming convention.
